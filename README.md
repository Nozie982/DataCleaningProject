# Student Performance Data Cleaning  

## 1. Overview  
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a dataset related to student performance factors. The goal is to improve data quality by:  
- Handling missing values  
- Removing duplicates  
- Correcting inconsistencies  
- Standardizing data formats  

A clean dataset ensures accurate analysis and meaningful insights.  

## 2. Dataset Information  
- **Name:** Student Performance Factors Dataset  
- **Description:** The dataset includes various factors affecting student performance, such as attendance, study hours, exam scores, and socio-economic background.   
- **File Format:** CSV  

## 3. Data Cleaning Steps  
The following cleaning steps are performed:  
1. **Handling Missing Values** – Filling or removing missing data.  
2. **Removing Duplicates** – Ensuring no redundant records.  
3. **Correcting Data Inconsistencies** – Standardizing formats (e.g., date formats, categorical values).  
4. **Outlier Detection and Removal** – Identifying and handling anomalies in student scores and other metrics.  
5. **Standardizing Data Types** – Converting numerical and categorical data to appropriate types.  

## 4. Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (or any Python IDE)  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for exploratory data analysis and visualization)
